        <p>
          I am an MCA graduate with hands-on experience in WordPress development, where I worked on creating and customizing websites for three months. I also have practical experience in Python and Django for backend development, along with strong knowledge of databases such as SQL. Currently, I am expanding my skill set by learning React to strengthen my expertise in full-stack development.
